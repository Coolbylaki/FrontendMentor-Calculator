## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- Have their initial theme preference saved to local storage.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind
- Flexbox & Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- React - JS library
- Vite

### What I learned

The only two new things I learned from this project were how to set up and manage multiple themes and how to save theme choice to local storage. The rest was used to reinforce my Tailwind, React context and React reducer hooks before moving to advanced topics.

### Continued development

The last project I have done was Advice Generator from FrontendMentor. I felt like I needed to reinforce my React skills by something more challenging, from here I will learn Redux & React Router, go back to Country Api project by FM, add the router and start something more complex with Redux & Router.
